    "# Ungraded Lab (Optional): ETL Pipelines and Batch Predictions with Apache Beam and Tensorflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will create, train, evaluate, and make predictions on a model using [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). In particular, you will train a model to predict the molecular energy based on the number of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is marked as optional because you will not be interacting with Beam-based systems directly in future exercises. Other courses of this specialization also use tools that abstract this layer. Nonetheless, it would be good to be familiar with it since it is used under the hood by TFX which is the main ML pipelines framework that you will use in other labs. Seeing how these systems work will let you explore other codebases that use this tool more freely and even make contributions or bug fixes as you see fit. If you don't know the basics of Beam yet, we encourage you to look at the [Minimal Word Count example here](https://beam.apache.org/get-started/wordcount-example/) for a quick start and use the [Beam Programming Guide](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide) to look up concepts if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire pipeline can be divided into four phases:\n",
    " 1. Data extraction\n",
    " 2. Preprocessing the data\n",
    " 3. Training the model\n",
    " 4. Doing predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "You will focus particularly on Phase 2 (Preprocessing) and a bit of Phase 4 (Predictions) because these use Beam in its implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: This tutorial uses code, images, and discussion from [this  article](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/examples/molecules-walkthrough). We highlighted a few key parts and updated some of the code to use more recent versions. Also, we focused on making the lab running locally. The original article linked above contain instructions on running it in GCP. Just take note that it will have associated costs depending on the resources you use.*"

    "You've now completed all phases of the Beam-based pipeline! Similar processes are done under the hood by higher-level frameworks such as TFX and you can use the techniques here to understand their codebase better or to extend them for your own needs. As mentioned earlier, the [original article](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/examples/molecules-walkthrough) also offers the option to use GCP and to perform online predictions as well. Feel free to try it out but be aware of the recurring costs.\n",
